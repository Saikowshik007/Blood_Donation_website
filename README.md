# Blood Donors App 🩸 💉
Blood is essential for surgeries, cancer treatment, chronic illnesses, and traumatic injuries.
Whether a patient receives whole blood, red cells, platelets, or plasma, this lifesaving care starts with one person making a generous donation.
So, we saw the need to develop an app to connect all the blood donors and collect their personal details like name, address, blood group.
One can also see which donors are up for donating currently and which are not.  Users can log in/ create an account update their details, 
and also update their availability status.

This project is aimed to developing an real time location based Blood Donation Information. The Blood Donation Agent is to create an e-information about the donor and organization that are related to donating the blood. Through this application any person who is interested in donating the blood can register himself in the same way if any organization wants to register itself with this site that can also register. Moreover if any general consumer wants to make request blood online he can also take the help of this site based on his current location. Admin is the main authority who can do addition, deletion, and modification if required.
